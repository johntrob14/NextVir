# NextVir
As of 9/30, this repository has been made public for the submission of our manuscript: NextVir: Enabling Classification of Tumor-Causing
Viruses with Genomic Foundation Models for publication.

In the coming weeks, the code from the development environment will be documented and uploaded here, and the datasets and saved models will be available on zenodo.

In it's current state, this repository has only minimum functionality to train a NextVir-D model using main.py

## Acknowledgments
